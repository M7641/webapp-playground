# webapp-playground

## Purpose

This repository is my playground for Web Applications. It is purely to find what works for me as trying to read about the ecosystem and what's right is a fools errand currently.


```sh
docker compose -f compose.yaml up
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```
