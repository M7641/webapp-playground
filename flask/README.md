# Steps to run

```sh
flask --app app run --debug
```

Flask is based purely on a server and it sends HTML files to the client. To get interactivity you need to send JS along with the HTML. The `home.html` file shows how you could do this. No idea how elegant this is, and there is loads to learn with this framework.

I also added a way to redirect to another page. Odd stuff given how different this is compared to Dash. It has the feel of being old. Good experience though and would not be a waste of time to do a project in this.
