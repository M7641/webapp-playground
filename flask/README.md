# Steps to run

```sh
flask --app home run --debug
```

Flask is based purely on a server and it sends HTML files to the client. To get interactivity you need to send JS along with the HTML.

I would like to add an example of how to do the interactivity with Flask before moving on to the next thing. It is worth remembering that Dash is based on Flask, but has also found a way to include React.
